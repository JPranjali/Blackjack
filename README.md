# Blackjack
This application is a simple BlackJack game.
The start button initiates the game by distributing two cards to the dealer and two to the player. 
One of the dealer's card is faced down and rest of the cards are faced up.
A player can either hit or stay. 
If the player hits, one more card is given to the player.
If the sum of face values of player's cards is greater than 21, the player gets busted.
Player can stay if he/she is not yet busted and doesn't want to hit.
On stay, dealer's down-facing card is shown up. 
The sum of dealer's card-facevalues is calculated. Scores of dealer and player are compared. 
Whoever has a max score which is less than or equal to 21 wins!
